# EvoRoads - Horizon Europe 
The EC-funded project **EvoRoads** (Evolutionary Solutions for Realising a Holistic Safe System Approach for All Road Users) is committed to advancing the European Union's Vision Zero initiative by implementing a comprehensive framework that integrates innovative models, tools, and services for data-driven safety assessments. 

The project focuses on developing of a connectivity platform that digitalises transport infrastructure assets while enabling the seamless integration of safety assessment services. By leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, EvoRoads analyses infrastructure monitoring data at various geospatial levels, enabling proactive risk warnings and supporting road operators in managing maintenance more effectively, enhancing safety and operational efficiency. It also defines safety criteria and quantification methods for key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor safety performance as part of the "Safe System" approach.

The results are developed alongside five axes: 
1. an **Evolutionary Safety Assessment Framework** setting the basis by defining how to measure road safety in a multilayered catalogue; 
2. a **Road Asset & Safety Management Digital Twin** collecting and distributing safety data; 
3. **Advanced Monitoring Safety Systems** that leverage data to provide infrastructure owners with clear insights into the safety levels of their roads; 
4. **Proactive Safety Warning Systems** ensuring that critical safety issues are raised pro-actively and in real-time to prevent safety hazards; 
5. and finally, all these results are combined in **Solutions Integration, Augmentation and Impact Assessment** tools and products allowing for take-up of the results in the wider market. These axes converge into a Safe Mobility Data Space where all data related to EvoRoads’ safety criteria and solutions are combined.

EvoRoads’ methodologies and technologies will be validated in four Living Labs (LLs) addressing diverse road user scenarios across urban and rural environments to ensure broad applicability and effectiveness. EvoRoads LLs are situated in Spain (focusing on Hazard-aware assets for better infrastructure safety level for existing and future roads users), Italy (focusing on Dynamic Road infrastructure safety diagnosis enhanced by emerging vehicle and digital technologies), Latvia (focusing on Automated (advanced) low-cost infrastructure monitoring and diagnostics: road hot spots, bridges, tunnels), and Romania (focusing on Remote sensing and warning technologies for better infrastructure and road conditions).

The EvoRoads project runs from May 2024 until April 2027. A scale-up event is foreseen towards the end of the project to allow for the wider market to consider EvoRoads’ results and to help provide ways forward.

EvoRoads is funded under the EU Horizon Europe programme.
